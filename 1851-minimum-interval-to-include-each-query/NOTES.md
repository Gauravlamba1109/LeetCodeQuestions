Explanation
* Sort queries and intervals.
* Iterate queries from small to big,
* and find out all open intervals [l, r],
* and we add them to a priority queue.
* Also, we need to remove all closed interval from the queue.
*
* In the priority, we use
* [interval size, interval end] = [r-l+1, r] as the key.
*
* The head of the queue is the smallest interval we want to return for each query.
*
